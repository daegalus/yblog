Then my first real job was in Delphi, so the Pascal found its way back in my life, and I started thinking: \"What was I on about with Java?\" Later PHP, JavaScript, Python, VB, VBA, VB.Net, C#, etc. Much the same scenario applied, though I must say PHP gave me the same sic feeling as Perl, and to some measure C++, but that's due to it's enigma-code-like usage of strange and not-so-wonderful off-putting characters. Only after some years did I realize there's not much difference at all, except maybe for Lisp which I've had some dealings with since the late 80's.

So if you don't do a zero, then some devices may get confused. Next you need to invoke it like this \"mkudffs --blocksize=512 --media-type=hd --utf8 --lvid=DriveLabel --vid=DriveLabel --fsid=DriveLabel /dev/device\" (you don't need a partition table, especially since there is no UDF partition id, which confuses some OSs). That blocksize is rather important. Also note that you *must* unmount properly, especially in Windows, otherwise you can lose write support on windows. You need to mount it on linux to have write access again (something wrong with Windows' implementation?).\n\nNow I must admit I haven't gotten this to work in OSX, but that is more not having one then anything. I'm pretty sure OSX has its own cli tool to format devices as UDF, which may be compatible with other OSs, but I can't try it.",

Unfortunately, UAC ruins the party here: you lose the ability to run executables under Vista/7/8 (regular EXEs will work, but anything that requires elevation or admin privilegies -like installers, for example- will FAIL with a obscure error message related to network paths). No fix (except for disabling UAC which is a big NO-NO) because this behaviour is intentional by MS unless you stick to FAT/NTFS/UDF.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- UDF: Works wonders for small volumes. You lose XP write compatibility (only one driver was ever developed with write support for HDDs, SAI' WriteUDF! - it costs $89, and the company is now defunct, so if you still care about XP, better bite the bullet and buy a new PC). Unfortunately for large volumes (like my 2TB external), no filesystem check tool in this world will recognize it (tried with chkdsk and Solaris/OpenIndiana UDF fsck: both complain about the device having no filesystem). And no fsck under Linux means that if you care about data integrity you should not be using UDF.

But on USB-attached drives it doesn't matter at all which FS you do pick - write performance is pretty much equal between NTFS, ext3 and UDF (albeit CPU usage is MUCH higher with NTFS when combined with the highly-CPU-bound USB interface). Symlinks come for free if you're using Vista or later. UNIX/POSIX file permissions require a user mapping file for ntfs-3g, after adding it, it works pretty much as expected.
