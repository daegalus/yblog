Hello and welcome to my digital garden. Below you will find various sections to explore.

A little about me. I am a DevOps Engineer and have been working in the field for 13 years.

I live in Denmark with my family, after moving here in September 2024 from the USA. I lived there
the 30 years prior. I was born in Bulgaria and moved to the USA when I was 5.
