I was after a filesystem format that has high limitations, e.g. filesystem size and file length, but a very simple layout and structure so that a driver for it is simple and can be ported widely including, for example, to small embedded environments, even if read-only there.  To be cross-platform, I assumed native attributes would have to be as meta-data tags on a file.  The simplicity would hit performance, e.g. files can't be fragmented, but then ease of implementation is valued over performance.</p><p>For your needs, plain UDF was the best hope I found.

        "raw_message": "I've wondered this too but from a slightly different angle.  I was after a filesystem format that has high limitations, e.g. filesystem size and file length, but a very simple layout and structure so that a driver for it is simple and can be ported widely including, for example, to small embedded environments, even if read-only there.  To be cross-platform, I assumed native attributes would have to be as meta-data tags on a file.  The simplicity would hit performance, e.g. files can't be fragmented, but then ease of implementation is valued over performance.\n\n\nFor your needs, plain UDF was the best hope I found.  Does it matter Linux doesn't do beyond 2.01?",

I've just tried it for myself again, just to see how \"difficult\" / time consuming this idea is.

Then another 1 min to setup a shortcut in the Startup menu to load that VM as a headless guest so it's available as soon as I login without me needing to click anything. Then I tested throughput using around 5GB of files to copy onto it, went at 65 MB/s, and copying off was 58MB/s - a LOT faster than the \"commercial\" NAS - and that's without me even trying to optimize the thing and only working through the VBox's virtual disc (which obviously slows things down as well, a RAW disc would perform at near max speed).

        "message": "<p>I was on the same situation - just upgraded to Windows 7, and got a 2TB external HDD. However, OSX isn't on my list of requirements. Did my experiments:</p><p>- FAT32: No way in hell. Once you add DVD9 ISOs and VM images, it quickly loses. Plus it has no POSIX permissions, no symlinks, heavy fragmentation... Just say NO.</p><p>- ext3: There are a couple of very good drivers for Windows, Ext2IFS and ext2fsd. Sure, you lose journaling, but still, both are very solid drivers that I had been using for ages in XP (good performance, rock-solid stability). Unfortunately, UAC ruins the party here: you lose the ability to run executables under Vista/7/8 (regular EXEs will work, but anything that requires elevation or admin privilegies -like installers, for example- will FAIL with a obscure error message related to network paths). No fix (except for disabling UAC which is a big NO-NO) because this behaviour is intentional by MS unless you stick to FAT/NTFS/UDF.</p><p>- UDF: Works wonders for small volumes. You lose XP write compatibility (only one driver was ever developed with write support for HDDs, SAI' WriteUDF! - it costs $89, and the company is now defunct, so if you still care about XP, better bite the bullet and buy a new PC). Unfortunately for large volumes (like my 2TB external), no filesystem check tool in this world will recognize it (tried with chkdsk and Solaris/OpenIndiana UDF fsck: both complain about the device having no filesystem). And no fsck under Linux means that if you care about data integrity you should not be using UDF. Oh, if your volume gets flagged as dirty, <i>unfortunately Linux won't \"unlock\" it for Windows, only chkdsk will do</i>... and it also means that since chkdsk won't deal with such large volumes (&gt;1TB?), your FS ends tied to Linux anyway. Close, but no cigar. But for small devices (pendrives?), it's the way to go as long as you don't need XP write access.</p><p>- NTFS: Sure, write performance sucks for native SATA drive/controller pairs. But on USB-attached drives it doesn't matter at all which FS you do pick - write performance is pretty much equal between NTFS, ext3 and UDF (albeit CPU usage is MUCH higher with NTFS when combined with the highly-CPU-bound USB interface). Symlinks come for free if you're using Vista or later. UNIX/POSIX file permissions require a user mapping file for ntfs-3g, after adding it, it works pretty much as expected. Limited error checking support under Linux, but for mutliboot scenarios, it doesn't matter that much anyway as long as one OS agrees to check and fix your FS.</p><p>- exFAT: Is this a bad joke!?!??! Patent minefield, sucky drivers outside Windozeland, hyperpropietary specs... <b>NO.</b></p><p>As usual, Microsoft is ruining the party. But I guess that I will settle with NTFS for the time being... And no, for home users with limited budgets and rational download/storage requirements, NAS <b>is not</b> the solution.</p>",

        "raw_message": "I was on the same situation - just upgraded to Windows 7, and got a 2TB external HDD. However, OSX isn't on my list of requirements. Did my experiments:\n\n- FAT32: No way in hell. Once you add DVD9 ISOs and VM images, it quickly loses. Plus it has no POSIX permissions, no symlinks, heavy fragmentation... Just say NO.\n\n- ext3: There are a couple of very good drivers for Windows, Ext2IFS and ext2fsd. Sure, you lose journaling, but still, both are very solid drivers that I had been using for ages in XP (good performance, rock-solid stability). Unfortunately, UAC ruins the party here: you lose the ability to run executables under Vista/7/8 (regular EXEs will work, but anything that requires elevation or admin privilegies -like installers, for example- will FAIL with a obscure error message related to network paths). No fix (except for disabling UAC which is a big NO-NO) because this behaviour is intentional by MS unless you stick to FAT/NTFS/UDF.\n\n\n\n- UDF: Works wonders for small volumes. You lose XP write compatibility (only one driver was ever developed with write support for HDDs, SAI' WriteUDF! - it costs $89, and the company is now defunct, so if you still care about XP, better bite the bullet and buy a new PC). Unfortunately for large volumes (like my 2TB external), no filesystem check tool in this world will recognize it (tried with chkdsk and Solaris/OpenIndiana UDF fsck: both complain about the device having no filesystem). And no fsck under Linux means that if you care about data integrity you should not be using UDF. Oh, if your volume gets flagged as dirty, <i>unfortunately Linux won't \"unlock\" it for Windows, only chkdsk will do</i>... and it also means that since chkdsk won't deal with such large volumes (>1TB?), your FS ends tied to Linux anyway. Close, but no cigar. But for small devices (pendrives?), it's the way to go as long as you don't need XP write access.\n\n\n\n- NTFS: Sure, write performance sucks for native SATA drive/controller pairs. But on USB-attached drives it doesn't matter at all which FS you do pick - write performance is pretty much equal between NTFS, ext3 and UDF (albeit CPU usage is MUCH higher with NTFS when combined with the highly-CPU-bound USB interface). Symlinks come for free if you're using Vista or later. UNIX/POSIX file permissions require a user mapping file for ntfs-3g, after adding it, it works pretty much as expected. Limited error checking support under Linux, but for mutliboot scenarios, it doesn't matter that much anyway as long as one OS agrees to check and fix your FS.\n\n\n\n- exFAT: Is this a bad joke!?!??! Patent minefield, sucky drivers outside Windozeland, hyperpropietary specs... <b>NO.</b>\n\n\nAs usual, Microsoft is ruining the party. But I guess that I will settle with NTFS for the time being... And no, for home users with limited budgets and rational download/storage requirements, NAS <b>is not</b> the solution.",
